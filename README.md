My task was to create a relational database schema that allows you to store data about subjects in cluster programs (and about the programs themselves), lecturers who teach certain subjects, invited speakers for certain subjects (keep in mind that the invited speaker can come without being tied to any of the subjects, students and their groups, reviews
students about teachers / speakers. Reviews should contain information about the date of the lesson, the text of the review, the evaluation of the lesson on a 5-point scale.
